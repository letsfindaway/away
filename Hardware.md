# Hardware

## Current situation

My current computer is equipped with two drives:

* a 250 GB SSD for Operating system and software (Drive C:)
* a 2 TB Hard drive for all of my data, photos, etc. (Drive D:)

For Linux I wand to boot from SSD, too, as I do not want to miss the speed of a non-rotating drive. However I also did not want to repartition the existing SSD, as 250 GB are not too much for Windows and all the software.

## Upgrade

So I decided to add another SSD for Linux and added a 500 GB Samsung Evo 860 drive. This drive shall be used for the Linux installation. It shall host the dual-boot bootloader, so that I can select between Linux and Windows for the transition period.

The case had sufficient space to add another drive and there was also a free SATA port on the motherboard, so this was not very complicated.

The 2 TB hard drive shall be accessible by either Windows or Linux, so that I have all of my data available whether I'm booting Windows or Linux. This makes transition much easier. The NTFS support in Linux is now mature enough to keep using this file system at least for the next months.
