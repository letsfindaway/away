# Selection of Linux distribution

## My requirements and expectations

Selecting the right Linux distribution is very often a matter of taste. For me the following points have been in focus:

* Stable and well maintained
* Support of KDE (that's just a personal taste!)
* Expected to be long lasting
* Easy to install and administrate

So I was focussing on the "big distributions" like Ubuntu, Red Hat, Suse, Debian, ... They are known to live for quite some time and can be expected to do so in the future. I did not want to change the distribution in the future very often, so a stable, future-proof and well maintained basis is a must.

KDE ist just my personal favorite. I'm sometimes using Ubuntu at work, and I could never get used to the Unity desktop. Ok, this is changing now and the're using Gnome, but anyway... The Kubuntu alternative didn't seem to me stable and long-lasting enough to be a real alternative.

Debian is the "mother of all distributions", but not as easy to use and administrate as others. I wanted to have some more guidance.

Red Hat is focussed on enterprises. No, I'm a personal user and do not expect that level of support they are offering, but instead wanted a distribution with good community support.

So finally my choice was OpenSuse. The're committed to KDE (amongst others), have good community support, provide an upgrade path, are quite stable, and have a nice Logo ;-)
