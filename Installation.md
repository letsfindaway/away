# Download distribution

First I downloaded the x86_64 DVD image from https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/leap. This page also contains useful links about how to burn a DVD from an image under Windows or how to create a bootable USB stick.

I decided to create a DVD. Under Windows 7 this is very easy: right-click on the image file and select "Burn DVD". Easy!

Then I booted from the DVD and followed the usual installation procedure. As I had an additionad SSD installed in my computer, I offered only this drive to the installer.
