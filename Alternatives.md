# Alternatives

Some programs will not run under wine and also do not have a direct counterpart under Linux. here I'm looking for alternatives suitable for my purpose.


## VR NetWorks (Banking programm with HBCI chipcard support)

For my banking program I have quite some requirements. It has to

* support HBCI banking with chipcard
* support debits (Lastschriften)
* support retrieval of statements of bank account (Kontoauszug)

which is more as someone else might require. The only program I found was [Moneyplex](http://www.matrica.de/produkte/produktmpx.html) from Matrica software. I need the business variant for 140,- â‚¬.

## BackupServiceHome

## Notepad++

The KDE standard text editor Kate mainly has what I need. So I will currently not look for something else.

## Putty

The console `ssh` client will do it for the time being. Perhaps I have to dig a little bit into the offered features to make it easier to manage several often used hosts.

## WinSCP

`Krusader` is an andvanced file manager for the KDE desktop which also support `SFTP`.

## Ulead PhotoImpact

I liked this graphics program a lot on Windows, because it offers a rich feature set without the steep learning curve other programs require. It also allows to use a scanner from within the program.

Working through the huge list of possible alternatives is still a 

TODO
