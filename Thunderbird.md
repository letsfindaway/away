# Thunderbird

For managing my e-mail I used Thunderbird for years - and I just wanted to continue with that. Thunderbird is not installed by default, but of course also available as package from the YaST software manager. Some easy clicks and it was installed.

I'm one of those people who download their mail from the server and delete them there using the good old POP protocol. So I have all my former e-mails archived on my own computer and backup system. To have a real working dual boot system I want to use the same folders for the downloaded e-mails.

To share the folder, I first entered my e-mail address and password. After Thunderbird successfully connected to the server, the program gave me the choice of IMAP or POP3. Here I clicked on the "advanced" options and further to extended options. Here I selected "Local folders" on the left and could then enter the path to the local e-mail folders on my Windows NTFS drive.

Before giving Thunderbird avvess to these folders I made a backup copy - just in case...

But all I had to do was to adjust the settings to my personal preferences and Thunderbird was working just as on Windows...
