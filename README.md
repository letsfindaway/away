## Away from Windows

After using Windows since version 2.1 I have now decided that Windows 7 is the last version I will ever use. An operating system where the Manufacturer adds and removes features at will, sends telemetry data to his servers without noting and uses the users as some kind of beta testers for the enterprise customers is not what I want to have on my computer.

On the other side: yes, there are really some things I got accustomed to over the last years, and I'm not sure how daily live with a Linux computer can look like.

However I think I'm sufficiently skilled to solve the upcoming problems. So I decided to go the way ...

## A way to Linux

From today I'm starting a soft migration to Linux, and I plan to be finished before the support for Windows 7 ends. I want to document and share my experiences and steps. First of all for myself, because I might have to reproduce this procedure on other computers I manage in my family. But of course also for others playing around with the idea to say good bye to Windows and hello to Linux!
