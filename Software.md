# List of commonly used software

The programs used in daily business are the ones which are most important to have a good counterpart on the Linux side. Here I provide a list of my important applications and some first ideas on how to replace them (if at all). The list is divided into three categories: Things which are easily available on Linux, things which could probably run in wine and things where I will look for a replacement.

## Available on Linux

* [Firefox](Firefox.md)
* [KeePass and the Kee plugin for Firefox](Firefox.md) (runs with mono)
* [Thunderbird](Thunderbird.md)
* Cewe Foto
* OwnCloud client
* git
* Java
* QtCreator
* Arduino IDE

## Probably runs on Wine

* Picasa
* Microsoft Word
* Microsoft Excel
* Microsoft Powerpoint
* Microsoft Access
* SteuerSparErkl√§rung
* TZ-EasyBuch (Bookkeeping, give it a try on Wine)

## Looking for an alternative

* VR NetWorks (Banking programm with HBCI chipcard support)
* BackupServiceHome 
* Notepad++
* Putty
* WinSCP
* Ulead PhotoImpact
